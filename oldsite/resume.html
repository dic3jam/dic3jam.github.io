	   <h2>Cover Letter</h2>	
	  
	   <p>To Whom it May Concern,</p><br>
	   <p>I am a former Army Armor Officer seeking a position as a Software Engineer. Since receiving my honorable discharge from Active Duty, I decided to follow my real passion and pursue a career in Software Engineering. I have completed the Advanced Software Development Certificate at Vermont Technical College on top of a Bachelors in Business Management from Norwich University. Coupled with 5 years of project management, customer-facing sales, and a just-do-it attitude, I intend to be a value building asset for your organization.</p><br>
	   <p>If you are familiar with the concepts of “drinking from a firehouse” or the sink or swim mentality, then you would understand the techniques used behind trainig military officers. Mastery of concepts is expected to happen quickly, there is very little time for coddling and structured development. This conditioning has made me extremely self-reliant and ravenous in the pursuit of knowledge. As an Army Officer, what you know and don’t know could effect the lives of 35 plus soldiers (and more as your career progresses) and their families. I look forward to not having lives on the line if I am accepted at your company, but the mindset will never escape me, and I believe that there are many similarities in profit-motivated organizations. As an Armored Reconaissance Platoon Leader, I had to familiarize myself with the Bradley Fighting vehcile to be able to command one, and 5 others. As a Tank Comapny Executive Officer, I had to rapidly transition my domain knowledge to become a leader on the Abrams Main Battle Tank as well. My ability to ask thoughtful questions, humbly seek the knowledge of those before me, research, and devour every resouce on the topic, enabled my success. I shot Top Bradley as a Platoon Leader, and Top Tank as an Executive Officer.</p><br>
	   <p>Throughout my military career and early life I was always talented with computers but never pursued the topic much past excel functions and macros. Once I started to learn more, I could not stop. I became obsessed with knowing everyhting I could know, and eventually I realized that being a Software Engineer was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I plan to transition this passion and eagerness to learn to my career.</p><br>
	   <p>I promise I am the most soft-skilled applicant for this position. I intend to back up my work-ethic and passion with a combination of late night self-study, and institute accredited education. I encourage you to view these projects <strong>TODO</strong> <strong>TODO</strong> <strong>TODO</strong> to see for yourself the work I can create.</p><br>
<p>Very Respectfully,</p><br>
<p>James DiCesare</p><br>
