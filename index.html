<h3>What is Jim thinking about?</h3> 

<p><a href="/2021/06/04/how-to-speak.html">The first essay of the Three Pillars is out!</a> Please give it a read! I have not configured a comments system yet but if you have constuctive criticism feel free to send me an email.</p>

<p>I am working at an internship during the day and studying for coding interviews at night. Life is very full!</p>

<h4>I can read</h4>
<p>
I am currently reading Stephen King's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a>
in support of the second pillar, How To Write. I did not know that he struggled with drugs and alcohol. Interesting fact: Stephen King was so high/drunk while writing 
some of his books that he does not remember writing them! That explains why a lot of them are so messed up. I have actually never read a Stephen King book as, frankly, 
I am too much of a chicken to partake in the horror genre of anything. But, I may have to attempt it. It is interesting to read about how he crafts his characters and 
stories, and I think I may need to see the real deal to understand his methods. First and foremost, Stephen King considers himself a storyteller, and there is a lot
in On Writing that can lend itself to being able to tell stories in other mediums.

Again, life is very full right now and I am not sure when the Pillar 2 essay will be out, but hopefully I can write and publish it before August. I do not anticipate
the Pillar 3 essay being out until the end of this year, as I believe there will be a lot of research involved.
