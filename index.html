<h3>What is Jim thinking about?</h3> 
	   <h4>What do you think?</h4>
	   <p>Coronavirus certainly has captured the world's attention. While I have those who are sick in my thoughts (or in my disciplined wearing of my mask) I cannot help but think of what will come after. As always <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/452538884/radiolab">My boys over at Radiolab</a> have created six excellent dispatches on the consequences of the Spanish Flu in 1918, and how the predecessors of that virus have changed the world.</P>

	   <h4>I can read</h4>
	   <p>I am currently reading a great book that explains the organization of computation in a very thoughful and unique way <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735611319/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Code</a> starts off with you developing the most efficient means to talk to your best friend across the street, and teaches you number systems from the persepctive of a lobster. I plan to do a write up on it when I am finished.</p>
