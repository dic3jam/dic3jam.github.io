	   <p>I was deeply disturbed by the trends in education during the pandemic. I have friends who are teachers describing the cover ups and shenanigans they deal with at their level. At the college level I see webcam footage of (grown?) men in their pajamas at 2 in the afternoon. I did college during the pandemic and ya know what? I liked it and I thrived. I plan to write a post about how I kept myself on track, especially in the deep winter months.</p>

	   <p>I also recently listened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">To this YouTube video on how to speak</a>. Something he says at the beginning of the video: "You are judged by 1. your ability to speak, 2. your ability to write, and 3. the content of your ideas" enamorated me so much that I realized I had to devote some time to my self-development in these areas. I have developed a little after hours curriculum for myself to dive into these topics. I plan to write an essay on each one, and those will roll out this summer. We'll call it the 3 pillars series.</p>

	   <h4>I can read</h4>
	   <p>Currently reading the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> for the second time. What surprises me most is the timeless nature of humans. We are the same now as we were in the 1920s as we were 10,000 years ago.</p>
